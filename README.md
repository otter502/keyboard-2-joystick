# Development

Goal: have something that converts keyboard inputs to a virtual joystick based on an easily editable config file, similair to the GLASS tool used in FRC

| Needs             | wants | Nice to have |
| --------          | ------- | ---- |
| config            | running in background    |  GUI to edit config   |
| virtual xbox controller  | Easy way to enable and disable (toolbar?)   |  different ways of pressing button (ramping, on-off, sticky, etc)  |
| keyboard to joystick remapping |  switching between configs by loading them   |   |

the keyboard input will be the scan code as a decimal
